This is a simple, generic implementation of a Stack data structure. The implementation includes methods to push and pop elements from the stack, as well as methods to obtain information like the number of elements within the stack, the stack's maximum capacity, whether or not the stack is full/empty, and the top most element of the stack. This implementation includes an override for the copy constructor as well as overriden assignment, equality, and inequality operators. Each node within the stack is represented by a struct containing the data point and a pointer to the next node.
