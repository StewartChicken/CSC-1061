This is a simple, generic implementation of a Queue data structure. The implementation includes methods to enqueue and dequeue elements from the queue, as well as methods to obtain information like the number of elements within the queue, the queue's maximum capacity, whether or not the queue is full/empty, and the front most element of the queue. This implementation includes an override for the copy constructor as well as overriden assignment, equality, and inequality operators. Each node within the queue is represented by a struct containing the data point and a pointer to the next node.
