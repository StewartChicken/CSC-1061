This is the code for my final project within my data structures class. It was written in Visual Studio so
many of the file paths within the code will no longer work, but the code is all here. The project creates
a fantasy football simulation game where the user builds a roster of players and plays against four other NPC
football teams. The algorithm which dictates the score of the game is very straight forward: it simply takes
a combination of averages between the different team stats. This program implements various intermediate Cpp
concepts like polymorphism, pointers, and abstract data types.
