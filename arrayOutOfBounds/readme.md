Implements a new kind of array in which array out of bounds errors are not possible. If the user attempts to access an index that is out of bounds, they are prompted with an error. 
This will also allow the user to index using negative values. This was written for a programming assignment for my data structures class. The goal of this assignment was
to practice and reinforce the concept of operator overloading, destructors, and basic pointers.
